Car Service Booking CLI

# Problem Statement
Car garages and service stations often keep records on paper or in memory. This makes it hard to track customers, their cars and service appointments. As a result, services can be forgotten, appointments missed, and customers may not know their car’s service history.

# Solution Statement
The Car Service Booking CLI is a simple text-based program that helps garages and car owners keep records in one place. It allows adding customers, registering their cars, and booking service appointments. It also keeps a clear history of services so nothing is lost or forgotten.
